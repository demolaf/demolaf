I'm a Software Engineer currently building Mobile applications for Flutter and Native iOS. I got into mobile application development because of how versatile and useful they are in particularly how "mobile" they can be of course 😜. 
I enjoy building products that create an impact in an individuals day to day life.
I also love architecting mobile applications from end to end and ensuring I write clean and testable code that can scale long term.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on 
  - Developing mobile applications with Flutter and Native iOS
  - Picking up backend development in the nearest future.
* 🌱 I’m constantly improving as a Software Engineer

Most applications have a way of handling immediate or long running background tasks that gives some kind of information or notification or just does something in the background (while your app is “inactive / in the foreground”). This type of process is termed persistent work meaning it will continue to run / remain scheduled even when your app is closed or your device is restarted and there’s also impersistent work which is no longer scheduled after execution.

When loading list views with data in flutter, we load tons of data at a go and this can affect the performance of your application negatively in the long run.
Loading list views with data in most cases happens asynchronously (might take a while to get the actual data). During this, applications use time and resources to get this data.
Pagination is the process of dividing a document (could be a list) anything that can be divided into sections, into discrete pages. This how your search engines which I think should be the most common example...
