I'm a Software Engineer currently building Mobile applications for Flutter and Native iOS. I got into mobile application development because of how versatile and useful they are in particularly how "mobile" they can be of course 😜. 
I enjoy building products that create an impact in an individuals day to day life.
I also love architecting mobile applications from end to end and ensuring I write clean and testable code that can scale long term.

Most applications have a way of handling immediate or long running background tasks that gives some kind of information or notification or just does something in the background (while your app is “inactive / in the foreground”). This type of process is termed persistent work meaning it will continue to run / remain scheduled even when your app is closed or your device is restarted and there’s also impersistent work which is no longer scheduled after execution.
